Factor Xa cleaves p-nitroaniline from the chromogenic substrate. The determinations were carried out in microtitre plates as follows.The test substances, in various concentrations, were dissolved in DMSO and incubated at 25 C. with human FXa (0.5 nmol/l dissolved in 50 mmol/l of tris buffer [C,C,C-tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane], 150 mmol/l of NaCl, 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin), pH=8.3) for 10 minutes. Pure DMSO was used as control. The chromogenic substrate (150 umol 11 of Pefachrome FXa from Pentapharm) was then added. After an incubation time of 20 minutes at 25 C., the extinction at 405 nm was determined.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens		9606	Autocuration	BAO_0000357	194	CHEMBL244	SINGLE PROTEIN	P00742	Coagulation factor X	Homo sapiens	9	Protein	Trypsin	high	94505	CHEMBL3638623			2014

The determinations were carried out in microtitre plates as follows.The test substances, in various concentrations, were dissolved in DMSO and incubated at 25 C. with human FXa (0.5 nmol/l dissolved in 50 mmol/l of tris buffer [C,C,C-tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane], 150 mmol/l of NaCl, 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin), pH=8.3) for 10 minutes. Pure DMSO was used as control. The chromogenic substrate (150 umol 11 of Pefachrome FXa from Pentapharm) was then added. After an incubation time of 20 minutes at 25 C., the extinction at 405 nm was determined.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens		9606	Autocuration	BAO_0000357	194	CHEMBL244	SINGLE PROTEIN	P00742	Coagulation factor X	Homo sapiens	9	Protein	Trypsin	high	94505	CHEMBL3638623			2014

The determinations were carried out in microtitre plates as follows.The test substances, in various concentrations, were dissolved in DMSO and incubated at 25 C. with human FXa (0.5 nmol/l dissolved in 50 mmol/l of tris buffer [C,C,C-tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane], 150 mmol/l of NaCl, 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin), pH=8.3) for 10 minutes. Pure DMSO was used as control. The chromogenic substrate (150 umol 11 of Pefachrome FXa from Pentapharm) was then added. After an incubation time of 20 minutes at 25 C., the extinction at 405 nm was determined.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens		9606	Autocuration	BAO_0000357	194	CHEMBL244	SINGLE PROTEIN	P00742	Coagulation factor X	Homo sapiens	9	Protein	Trypsin	high	94505	CHEMBL3638623			2014

The determinations were carried out in microtitre plates as follows.The test substances, in various concentrations, were dissolved in DMSO and incubated at 25 C. with human FXa (0.5 nmol/l dissolved in 50 mmol/l of tris buffer [C,C,C-tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane], 150 mmol/l of NaCl, 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin), pH=8.3) for 10 minutes. Pure DMSO was used as control. The chromogenic substrate (150 umol 11 of Pefachrome FXa from Pentapharm) was then added. After an incubation time of 20 minutes at 25 C., the extinction at 405 nm was determined.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens		9606	Autocuration	BAO_0000357	194	CHEMBL244	SINGLE PROTEIN	P00742	Coagulation factor X	Homo sapiens	9	Protein	Trypsin	high	94505	CHEMBL3638623			2014
